## 🛠️ Technical Details

### **Built With**
- **HTML5 Canvas** for game rendering and graphics
- **CSS3** with CSS Variables for theming and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for game logic and interactivity
- **LocalStorage** for persistent game data and preferences

### 🖼️ Favicon on GitHub Pages
Each HTML page explicitly links `favicon.ico` so icons resolve correctly at `/idlegames/` on GitHub Pages instead of the site root.

### 🔒 Parental Controls

The launcher includes a lightweight client-side Parental Controls feature. From the main `index.html` you can open the Parental Controls modal (top-left "🔒 Parental" button) to:
- Set a password (enter it twice) and enable controls
- Sign in to an admin mode that shows per-item checkboxes (checked = visible)
- Apply & Enforce to lock the choices for non-logged-in users, or Disable to remove the password and allowed map

Storage details:
- The parental control state is stored locally in your browser's LocalStorage under the key `idlegames-parental-v1`.
- The password is hashed (SHA-256) with a randomized salt before storing. No server-side storage or transmission occurs.

Security note:
- This is a client-side convenience feature intended to prevent casual access. It is not a replacement for device-level parental controls. Because data and logic live in the browser, a technically capable user could bypass or reset the controls by clearing LocalStorage or editing the files.

### **Browser Compatibility**
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

### **Performance Optimized**
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Efficient canvas rendering techniques
- Optimized asset loading and memory usage
