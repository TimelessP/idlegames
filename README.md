## 🛠️ Technical Details

### **Built With**
- **HTML5 Canvas** for game rendering and graphics
- **CSS3** with CSS Variables for theming and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for game logic and interactivity
- **LocalStorage** for persistent game data and preferences

### � Progressive Web App
- Service worker precaches the entire collection for offline play.
- `assets/js/pwa.js` reads the centralized version constant in `assets/js/version.js` and prompts the user to refresh once a new build is available.
- `manifest.webmanifest` and bundled icons enable installation on desktop and mobile.
- All runtime dependencies (Three.js, QRious, jsQR, Transformers.js, Inter font) are vendored into `assets/vendor/` and `assets/fonts/` during the build so the experience is self-contained.

### �🖼️ Favicon on GitHub Pages
Each HTML page explicitly links `favicon.ico` so icons resolve correctly at `/idlegames/` on GitHub Pages instead of the site root.

### 🔒 Parental Controls

The launcher includes a lightweight client-side Parental Controls feature. From the main `index.html` you can open the Parental Controls modal (top-left "🔒 Parental" button) to:
- Set a password (enter it twice) and enable controls
- Sign in to an admin mode that shows per-item checkboxes (checked = visible)
- Apply & Enforce to lock the choices for non-logged-in users, or Disable to remove the password and allowed map

Storage details:
- The parental control state is stored locally in your browser's LocalStorage under the key `idlegames-parental-v1`.
- The password is hashed (SHA-256) with a randomized salt before storing. No server-side storage or transmission occurs.

Security note:
- This is a client-side convenience feature intended to prevent casual access. It is not a replacement for device-level parental controls. Because data and logic live in the browser, a technically capable user could bypass or reset the controls by clearing LocalStorage or editing the files.

### **Browser Compatibility**
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

### **Performance Optimized**
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Efficient canvas rendering techniques
- Optimized asset loading and memory usage

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Play Online**
Simply visit [https://timelessp.github.io/idlegames/](https://timelessp.github.io/idlegames/) to start playing immediately.

### **Run Locally**
Idle Games uses plain **npm** for tooling and scripts—no bundlers or task runners beyond what ships in this repository. The workflow below mirrors what the CI pipeline executes.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TimelessP/idlegames.git
   cd idlegames
   ```
2. Install dependencies with npm (Node.js 20 LTS recommended, Node.js ≥18 supported):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the offline bundle into `dist/` (vendors Three.js examples, fonts, service worker, etc.):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. Preview locally with caching behaviours intact (rebuilds and serves `dist/` on port 4173):
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```
   The generated `dist/` folder is the exact payload deployed to GitHub Pages or any other static host.

## 🚢 Release Process

The service worker caches by version, so every public release needs a fresh build tied to a new semantic version.

1. **Bump the version.** Update the `version` field in `package.json` (e.g. `1.0.5`). Bump by +0.0.1 regardless of semantic versioning rules.
2. **Build & Update Lockfile.** Run `npm install && npm run build`. The install updates `package-lock.json` with the new version number, and the build updates the version in the app itself (regenerating `assets/js/version.js` and `dist/`).
3. **Commit and Push.** Commit the changes (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `assets/js/version.js`) and push to GitHub.

```bash
# 1. Update package.json version manually
# 2. Run build pipeline
npm install && npm run build

# 3. Commit and push
git add package.json package-lock.json assets/js/version.js
git commit -m "Release v1.0.109"
git push origin main
```

The GitHub Actions workflow (`build-and-deploy.yml`) will automatically pick up the push, build the project again (ensuring a clean environment), and deploy the `dist/` folder to GitHub Pages.

### ❤️ Love Letter Pro Tip: Solving the Race Condition

If you ever see two workflows running in parallel on GitHub Actions ("pages build and deployment" vs "Build and Deploy PWA") and getting 404 errors for `sw.js`:

**The Problem:** GitHub's default "Deploy from a branch" setting triggers a standard Pages workflow that competes with our custom PWA build workflow. If the default one wins, it deploys the raw source (ignoring `dist/`), breaking the app.

**The Fix:** Go to **Settings > Pages** in the repository. Under **Build and deployment**, change the **Source** from "Deploy from a branch" to **"GitHub Actions"**. This disables the default workflow and lets our custom `build-and-deploy.yml` handle everything perfectly. No more race conditions! <3
