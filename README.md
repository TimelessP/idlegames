## 🛠️ Technical Details

### **Built With**
- **HTML5 Canvas** for game rendering and graphics
- **CSS3** with CSS Variables for theming and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for game logic and interactivity
- **LocalStorage** for persistent game data and preferences

### � Progressive Web App
- Service worker precaches the entire collection for offline play.
- `assets/js/pwa.js` reads the centralized version constant in `assets/js/version.js` and prompts the user to refresh once a new build is available.
- `manifest.webmanifest` and bundled icons enable installation on desktop and mobile.
- All runtime dependencies (Three.js, QRious, jsQR, Transformers.js, Inter font) are vendored into `assets/vendor/` and `assets/fonts/` during the build so the experience is self-contained.

### �🖼️ Favicon on GitHub Pages
Each HTML page explicitly links `favicon.ico` so icons resolve correctly at `/idlegames/` on GitHub Pages instead of the site root.

### 🔒 Parental Controls

The launcher includes a lightweight client-side Parental Controls feature. From the main `index.html` you can open the Parental Controls modal (top-left "🔒 Parental" button) to:
- Set a password (enter it twice) and enable controls
- Sign in to an admin mode that shows per-item checkboxes (checked = visible)
- Apply & Enforce to lock the choices for non-logged-in users, or Disable to remove the password and allowed map

Storage details:
- The parental control state is stored locally in your browser's LocalStorage under the key `idlegames-parental-v1`.
- The password is hashed (SHA-256) with a randomized salt before storing. No server-side storage or transmission occurs.

Security note:
- This is a client-side convenience feature intended to prevent casual access. It is not a replacement for device-level parental controls. Because data and logic live in the browser, a technically capable user could bypass or reset the controls by clearing LocalStorage or editing the files.

### **Browser Compatibility**
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers

### **Performance Optimized**
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- Efficient canvas rendering techniques
- Optimized asset loading and memory usage

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Play Online**
Simply visit [https://timelessp.github.io/idlegames/](https://timelessp.github.io/idlegames/) to start playing immediately.

### **Run Locally**
Idle Games uses plain **npm** for tooling and scripts—no bundlers or task runners beyond what ships in this repository. The workflow below mirrors what the CI pipeline executes.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TimelessP/idlegames.git
   cd idlegames
   ```
2. Install dependencies with npm (Node.js 20 LTS recommended, Node.js ≥18 supported):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the offline bundle into `dist/` (vendors Three.js examples, fonts, service worker, etc.):
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. Preview locally with caching behaviours intact (rebuilds and serves `dist/` on port 4173):
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```
   The generated `dist/` folder is the exact payload deployed to GitHub Pages or any other static host.

## 🚢 Release Process

The service worker caches by version, so every public release needs a fresh build tied to a new semantic version. Use the checklist below to publish a new drop.

1. **Bump the version.** Pick the next semantic version and update the `version` field in `package.json` (e.g. `1.0.5`). The build script automatically regenerates `assets/js/version.js`; update any user-facing version display only if you want it visible in the UI.
2. **Regenerate the lockfile.** Run `npm install --package-lock-only` from the repo root. This keeps `package-lock.json` aligned with the new version number.
3. **Build the distributable.** Execute `npm run build`. The script rewrites `assets/js/version.js`, wipes `dist/`, copies the site, rewrites Three.js imports, vendors dependencies, and emits `dist/sw.js` with the new cache name (`IdleGames-vX.Y.Z`).
4. **Smoke test locally.** Launch `npm run serve`, open `http://localhost:4173`, and confirm the service worker registers, assets load, and any modified pages behave as expected. Stop the server when finished.
5. **Deploy GitHub Pages.** Replace the contents of the Pages branch (currently `gh-pages`) with the freshly built `dist/` directory. One manual workflow is:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   git worktree add ../idlegames-gh-pages gh-pages
   rsync -av --delete dist/ ../idlegames-gh-pages/
   cd ../idlegames-gh-pages
   git add .
   git commit -m "Release v1.0.5"
   git push origin gh-pages
   cd -
   git worktree remove ../idlegames-gh-pages
   ```
   Adjust the release version in the commit message. If you prefer another deployment method (GitHub Action, `gh-pages` npm package, etc.) swap in your workflow, but always publish the built `dist/` artifacts.
6. **Commit and tag main.** Back in the main worktree, commit the source changes (`package.json`, lockfile, docs) and optionally create a git tag (`git tag v1.0.5 && git push --tags`). This keeps the history aligned with the deployed build.

Following those steps ensures browsers detect the new cache version, prompt the in-app reload, and serve the latest assets after you publish.
